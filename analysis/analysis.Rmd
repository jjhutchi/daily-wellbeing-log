# Blog Post

I had some down time before beginning the summer math camp for my 
PhD, and decided it would be a good idea to begin tracking my 
personal wellbeing throughout my PhD. 

There were a couple key factors I wanted to include in my tracking progress: 

1. **Ease of use** - I wanted an application that I would be able to do on days where I didn't feel like doing anything. I decided to use `cronR` to automate a script that would send the survey link to my phone each morning. Paired with `pushoverr`, I now receive a push notification each morning that opens a Google Form containing one page of questions on my mental wellbeing. The entire process start to finish takes less than a minute to complete. 

2. **Configurable** - I want to create a question bank of information specific to myself which I would like to track. For this reason, I decided to avoid any pre-made apps. Google Forms allowed me to make my own survey to track the questions I am most interested in. Additionally, the google form automatically saves all entered information into a Google Sheet, which can easily be read into R for further analysis. 

3. **Reproducible** - I want to be able to make the information easy to share with others. The code base for the log is written in R Markdown, with the only external resource being Google Forms. This makes the project very easy for others to adopt. 


**Creating the tracker**

I followed these four steps to create my wellbeing tracker: 

1. Create a Google Form with the information you want to track. 
    * Collect the Google Form URL, this will be the URL we embed in our push notification. 
    * In results, click "View in Sheets", collect this URL as well, as it will be where we collect the response data. 
2. Set up a Pushover API to receive push notifications on your phone. 
    * install the `pushoverr` R library. 
    * install the Pushover app on your phone. 
    * create a Pushover application at [pushover.net](https://pushover.net/). This will provide a `USER_KEY`, and `API_KEY` needed for sending push notifications from R. 
    * For more info setting up Pushover, see Brian Connelley's blog post [R Phone Home: Notifications with pushoverr](https://bconnelly.net/posts/r-phone-home/).
3. Write R code to send push notifications. 
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # file name: send-push.R
    
    USER_KEY = "YYYYY"
    APP_KEY = "ZZZZZ"
    GOOGLE_FORM_URL = "XXXXX"
    
    pushoverr::pushover(message = "Enter your daily wellbeing information", 
                        user = USER_KEY, 
                        app = APP_KEY, 
                        url = GOOGLE_FORM_URL, 
                        url_title = "Wellbeing Link")
    
    ```
4. Schedule the R code to run daily.
    * I used `cronR` to schedule the send-push.R to run daily at 8:15am. 
    * This can be scheduled using `cronR::cron_add()`, or with the RStudio cronR addin "Schedule R Scripts on Linux/Unix". 
        * cronR is Linux/Unix based. For Windows machines, look to Task Scheduler or other automation processes. 

**1. Creating a Google Form**
You can find [Google Forms here](https://www.google.com/forms/about/). 
This step is as simple as making one question per insight you wish to 
track with your wellbeing tracker. 

For more information, you can my Daily Wellbeing repository [here - TBD]().

### Overall Perceived Sleep

# Information

I created this dashboard using the `flexdashboard` library in R Markdown. This dashboard is tracking my personal wellbeing. My motivation for this project came prior to beginning my PhD and wanting to be aware of how my mental state changed buring this process.
